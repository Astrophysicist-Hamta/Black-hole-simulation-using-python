# Black-hole-simulation-using-python
Non-spinning black hole simulation based on geodesics equation
This program takes equirectangular images as input and returns in the main folder the modified images deformed by the black hole.
Results are save in matrices to call them if a simulation using the same parameters are run.
A offset system can be used to simulate a moving background.
